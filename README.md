# SQL
In this Repository, I went through a series of SQL projects using data models ranging from the Rebrickable lego dataset to pizza sales dataset.

I went through real scenarios of answering questions about data with SQL. I went from basic queries to exploring complex problems using VIEWS, JOINS, CTEs, and WINDOW functions. I worked with the following skills in these projects:
- Creating a database in SQL Server
- Data Cleaning
- SQL Views
- SQL Joins
- SQL Window Functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
